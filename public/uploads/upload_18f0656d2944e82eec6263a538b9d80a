Which environments for each system
Is levels of access in scope (currently some systems are binary in access methods)
Risk of external control (messup by Hitachi impacts us no revert?)
What is the backup plan if solution is unavailable
Is it really a good idea to put such a high risk system in the cloud?
Access to SVN and Git, Jenkins
Impact of Devops implementation (Finops) on SoD, etc.
Access to staging (collaboration with UAT, more autonomy) - Impact?
